# Goodwill-nus

An app to extend (or receive) a helping hand!

A platform for making and accepting help requests to connect with fellow students.

Users can be helpers or helpees, accepting or making help requests, respectively.

Built in React, currently purely front-end.

Plans for the future:
1. Add backend (data storage etc.)
2. User log-in and auth
3. Chat feature
4. Improve UI/UX design
5. App notification (on request acceptance)
6. Reward system
