When you start with Good, the Good goes around.
This web application makes extending a helping hand or receiving help a walk in the park. 
Making Singapore a kinder place starts with us.

A platform for making and accepting help requests to connect with fellow students.

Users can be helpers or helpees, accepting or making help requests, respectively.

Built in React, currently purely front-end.

Plans for the future:
1. Add backend (data storage etc.)
2. User log-in and auth
3. Chat feature
4. Improve UI/UX design
5. App notification (on request acceptance)
6. Reward system
